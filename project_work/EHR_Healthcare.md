### **Infrastructure Setup & Networking**

These commands establish the foundational network infrastructure, ensuring secure, high-performance connectivity and low-latency content delivery for the web applications.

* **Create a custom VPC network** to provide an isolated environment for your resources.
    ```bash
    gcloud compute networks create ehr-vpc-network --subnet-mode=custom
    ```

* **Set up Cloud CDN** with an external HTTP(S) load balancer to cache content closer to users, reducing latency.
    ```bash
    # Create a backend service for the load balancer and enable CDN
    gcloud compute backend-services create ehr-web-backend-service --protocol=HTTP --global
    gcloud compute backend-services update ehr-web-backend-service --enable-cdn --global

    # Create a URL map to route incoming requests to your backend service
    gcloud compute url-maps create ehr-web-url-map --default-service ehr-web-backend-service

    # Create the target HTTP proxy
    gcloud compute target-http-proxies create ehr-http-proxy --url-map ehr-web-url-map

    # Create a global forwarding rule to handle user traffic
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules create ehr-http-forwarding-rule --global --target-http-proxy=ehr-http-proxy --ports=80
    ```

* **Establish a high-performance connection** to the on-premises data center using Dedicated Interconnect.
    ```bash
    # Create a Cloud Router required for the BGP session with the on-prem router
    gcloud compute routers create ehr-onprem-router --network ehr-vpc-network --asn 65001 --region us-central1

    # This command is conceptual for creating a Dedicated Interconnect VLAN attachment.
    # It requires an existing interconnect and pairing key from your provider.
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ehr-vlan-attachment --router ehr-onprem-router --region us-central1 --interconnect-name [INTERCONNECT_NAME]
    ```

***

### **GKE & Anthos for Application Modernization**

These commands create and manage the containerized environments on Google Cloud and integrate them with on-premises clusters for consistent management.

* **Create a regional GKE cluster** for high availability of customer-facing applications.
    ```bash
    gcloud container clusters create ehr-gke-cluster --region us-central1 --num-nodes=3 --release-channel=regular
    ```

* **Register the GKE cluster with Anthos** to enable unified, hybrid-cloud management.
    ```bash
    gcloud container hub memberships register ehr-gke-cluster-membership \
      --gke-cluster=us-central1/ehr-gke-cluster \
      --enable-workload-identity
    ```

* **(Concept) Register an on-premises Kubernetes cluster** with Anthos for consistent management across environments.
    ```bash
    # This command uses the gkeadm tool to prepare and register an on-prem cluster
    gkeadm create admin-cluster --config [CONFIG_FILE]
    gcloud container hub memberships register on-prem-cluster-membership \
      --context=[ON_PREM_KUBE_CONTEXT] \
      --kubeconfig=[KUBECONFIG_PATH]
    ```

***

### **Data Management & Analytics**

These commands provision managed databases to reduce administrative overhead and set up services to ingest, process, and analyze healthcare data.

* **Create managed database instances** to store relational data and cache sessions.
    ```bash
    # Create a Cloud SQL for MySQL instance
    gcloud sql instances create ehr-mysql-db --database-version=MYSQL_8_0 --region=us-central1 --cpu=4 --memory=16GB

    # Create a Memorystore for Redis instance for caching
    gcloud redis instances create ehr-redis-cache --size=5 --region=us-central1
    ```

* **Set up a data ingestion pipeline** using Pub/Sub and Dataflow.
    ```bash
    # Create a Pub/Sub topic to receive data from new providers
    gcloud pubsub topics create new-provider-data

    # Run a Dataflow job to process the data from Pub/Sub and load it into BigQuery
    # This assumes a pre-built Flex Template is stored in Google Cloud Storage
    gcloud dataflow flex-template run ehr-data-processing-job \
      --template-file-gcs-path gs://[TEMPLATE_BUCKET]/[TEMPLATE_FILE] \
      --region us-central1 \
      --parameters input_topic=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/new-provider-data,output_table=[PROJECT_ID]:ehr_data.provider_records
    ```

* **Create a BigQuery dataset** to centralize data for analytics and machine learning.
    ```bash
    bq --location=US mk --dataset ehr_data
    ```

***

### **Security & Identity**

These commands help maintain regulatory compliance by managing identity and protecting sensitive patient data (PII).

* **Set up a managed Active Directory domain** to sync on-premises user identities.
    ```bash
    gcloud beta domains managed-identities create ehr-managed-ad --region=us-central1 --authorized-networks=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/global/networks/ehr-vpc-network
    ```

* **Create a DLP inspection job** to scan for and classify PII in Cloud Storage.
    ```bash
    gcloud dlp jobs create inspect \
      --storage-config="cloud-storage-options={file-set={url=gs://ehr-document-bucket/*}}" \
      --inspect-template="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/inspectTemplates/pii_template" \
      --location="global"
    ```

* **Set up an interface for legacy insurance providers** using Apigee API Management.
    ```bash
    # This is a conceptual gcloud command as Apigee setup is complex and often UI-driven
    # The first step is typically to enable the services and provision an organization
    gcloud services enable apigee.googleapis.com
    gcloud alpha apigee organizations provision --region=us-central1 --analytics-region=us-central1
    ```

***

### **CI/CD & Operations**

These commands create a fully managed CI/CD platform and centralize operational tooling for logging, monitoring, and alerting.

* **Create an Artifact Registry repository** to store and manage container images.
    ```bash
    gcloud artifacts repositories create ehr-app-repo \
      --repository-format=docker \
      --location=us-central1 \
      --description="Docker repository for EHR applications"
    ```

* **Set up a CI/CD pipeline** using Cloud Build and Cloud Deploy.
    ```bash
    # Create a Cloud Build trigger to automatically build container images from a Git repo
    gcloud builds triggers create github --name="ehr-app-build-trigger" \
      --repo-name="[YOUR_REPO_NAME]" --repo-owner="[YOUR_GITHUB_OWNER]" \
      --branch-pattern="^main$" --build-config="cloudbuild.yaml"

    # Apply a Cloud Deploy delivery pipeline configuration
    gcloud deploy apply --file=delivery-pipeline.yaml --region=us-central1
    ```

* **Centralize logging and create monitoring alerts** for proactive action.
    ```bash
    # Create a logging sink to export all logs to BigQuery for long-term retention and analysis
    gcloud logging sinks create ehr-bq-log-sink bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/ehr_logs \
      --log-filter="severity>=WARNING"

    # Create a notification channel to send alerts to a specific email address
    gcloud monitoring channels create --display-name="EHR Ops Team" \
      --type=email --channel-labels=email_address="ops-team@example.com"
    ```
